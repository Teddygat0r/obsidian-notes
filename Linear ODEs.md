ODE is linear in y, y', y'', ...
No requirement on x

$$y'(x)+p(x)y=q(x)+r(x)*y'''(x)$$
This is linear.

$$sin(y)=x$$
This is nonlinear

For a linear ODE with constant coefficients $a(x)$ must be constant:
$$5y''+7y'+8y=f(x)$$ Linear ODE w/ constant coefficients
$$5xy'+8y=f(x)$$
Not constant coefficients.

An ODE is homogeneous if $f(x)=0$
